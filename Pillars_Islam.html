    <h1> Five Pillars of Islam </h1>
    <h2> 1. Faith </h2>
    <p> 
        This is the declaration of faith and the first pillar of Islam. It involves
        bearing witness and openly proclaiming the belief in the oneness of Allah 
        and the prophethood of Muhammad. The Shahada is often recited as follows: 
        "La ilaha illallah, Muhammadur rasulullah," which means "There is no god 
        but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah." 
    </p>
    <h2> 2. Prayer </h2>
    <p> 
        Muslims are required to perform five daily prayers facing the Kaaba in 
        Mecca. These prayers are known as Salat and are performed at specific times
        throughout the day and night. The five daily prayers are Fajr (before 
        sunrise), Dhuhr (midday), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (just after sunset), 
        and Isha (night).
    </p>
    <h2> 3. Fasting</h2>
    <p>
        Fasting during the holy month of Ramadan is the fourth pillar. Muslims fast
        from dawn (Fajr) until sunset (Maghrib) throughout the month of Ramadan. 
        Fasting involves abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs 
        during daylight hours. It is a spiritual practice aimed at self-discipline, 
        self-purification, and empathy for the less fortunate.
    </p>
    <h2> 4. Zakat </h2>
    <p>
        Zakat is the obligation to give a portion of one's wealth to those in need,
        typically 2.5% of one's savings and investments, after the deduction of 
        necessary expenses. It is a form of almsgiving and is intended to help the
         poor and needy.
    </p>
    <h2> 5. Hajj </h2>
    <p>
        Hajj is the fifth pillar and is a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in
        Saudi Arabia. It is obligatory for every Muslim who is physically and 
        financially able to undertake the journey at least once in their lifetime.
        Hajj occurs annually during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah and involves
         a series of rituals, including circumambulating the Kaaba, standing at 
         the plain of Arafat, and other acts of worship.
