    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Miracles of Quran </h1>
    <h2> 1. A Protective Covering </h2>
    <p> 
        Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says in the Quran, “And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away.” 
        [21: 32]

        The sky is not only beautiful to look at, but it also plays an important role in our survival. The Sun radiates energy in different 
        wavelengths – the shorter the wavelength, the greater the potential harm. Some of this energy, however, is required for crucial functions 
        such as photosynthesis in the plants and production of Vitamin D in human beings.
        Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) designed a mechanism that ensures only harmless rays reached the Earth. This mechanism is what we know as the 
        ‘ozone layer’. The scientists discovered this layer in the year 1913.
        That is not all. The atmosphere around us maintains a certain temperature suitable for our living. In absence of this, the temperature 
        would drop down to -270°C and we would freeze to death.
        The sky is our protective covering which prevents the celestial bodies from falling on us. Imagine if there was no sky and the stars and 
        the sun were not commanded by Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) to stay at their places, what would have happened? Things would have been falling 
        over our heads and everyday life would have become problematic.
    </p>
    <h2> 2. Holding Down the Earth </h2>
    <p>
        Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says, “And we placed within the Earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shift with them…” [21:31]

        The Earth that we live on is in a constant state of motion. We do not feel it because Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) placed gigantic mountains 
        to hold it down. This fact was unknown until the geologists discovered that mountains have roots deep under the surface of the ground. 
        These roots clench different plates of the Earth like a peg or an anchor to control and prevent it from shaking.
        The miracles of the Quran teach us to appreciate the artistry of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) and acknowledge the things that He has done for 
        us to make our survival possible.
        Imagine if there were no mountains, how we would have walked on this Earth when it was constantly shaking? Ask the people who have lived 
        through tremors or aftershocks after an earthquake. There is a constant fear.
    </p>
    <h2> 3. Coming Down in Decided Proportion </h2>
    <p> 
        “And who sends down rain from the sky in measured amounts, and We revive thereby a dead land…” [43:11]

        Every second, 16 million tons of water evaporates from the Earth, which means the same amount must be replaced by means of rain. Allah 
        maintains this balance by the process of the water cycle. Even a minor difference can result in a major ecological imbalance.
        Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) does not only decide the quantity of rain but also the speed with which it will come down. One can notice the 
        difference of speed when there is a storm and a drizzle. When the rain is heavy, it brings destruction and loss of lives and property. 
        When there is a light drizzle, nothing is affected. Therefore, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) taught us to ask Allah for beneficial 
        rain.
        It was in the 16th century when a French hydraulics engineer, Bernard Palissy, discovered the water cycle. In the 19th century, a German 
        physicist, Philipp Lenard, found the correlation between the speed of rainfall and the size of a raindrop.
